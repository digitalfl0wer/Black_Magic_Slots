# 🎰 Black Magic Reels

Black Magic Reels is my Afro-chic, ritual-inspired slot machine, small-batch, high drama. Under the hood it’s all deterministic core logic; on the surface it’s luxe casino fantasy with a dash of Black girl magic.

The reels aren’t just pretty: the symbols are pulled from Black and Afro-diasporic visual culture, so every spin feels like it’s speaking a language you actually recognize, not some generic “Vegas” clipart. ✨

## What it is (Its giving BIG CULTURE)

- **Ritual over random** – crypto-safe RNG spins weighted reel strips, a clean little state machine runs the game flow, and the engine evaluates 1 / 9 / 20 / 25 paylines with 3/4/5-of-a-kind wins. No mystery math, just transparent rules dressed up nice.
- **Afro-chic UI** – aurora-backed reels, glowing paylines, a “ritual stats” ribbon, and oversized balance/win text so you can *feel* every hit. Buttons have micro-interactions, wins get confetti + mood lighting, and near-misses still give you that little glow of “almost.”
- **Built-in respect + and ALWAYS necessary accessibility** – a gold-burger icon opens a modal for mute, volume, reduced motion, and high-contrast modes. Your preferences persist via `localStorage`, so your eyes and ears don’t have to re-negotiate every refresh.
- **Sound that follows your lead** – reel loops, payout chimes, and fanfare are wired into your settings, not blasting at you. Softer envelopes, celebratory but not chaotic, synced to the line callouts and win animations.
